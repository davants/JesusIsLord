Microsoft Api XAudio2 Course 101

This course is still be created.


This course has a set of projects that will help you learn how to read technical documentation
and use complex APIs.  The APIs will be the Microsoft XAudio APIs which can be used to 
make sounds play on the computer using Mp3 files. These APIs also allow for 3D sound, meaning
the sounds can be made to move around.


This course uses materials that are put together my different people from the industry. I would not expect 
them to be Christian, but probably have some Christian values because our culture was strongly influenced 
by Christianity. I avoid materials that use bad language or crude commentary.
I will include verses between lessons so we don't loose sight of what really matters. 

Exodus 20:16 - Old Testament
	You must not lie or deceive one another. 
	
Isaiah 53:5 - Old Testament
	.. he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities;
	upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed.
	
1 Peter 2:24
	"He himself bore our sins" in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live 
	for righteousness; "by his wounds you have been healed." 

Hebrews 11:6 
	.. and without faith it is impossible to please God, for whoever would draw near to God must 
	believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.
 
Acts 18 - 1 through 4
	Paul....met a certain Jew named Aquila...with his wife Priscilla... and because Paul was a 
	tentmaker as they were, he stayed and worked with them.
	Every Sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue, trying to persuade Jews and Greeks.
