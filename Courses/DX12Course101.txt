This course has a set of projects that will help you program in DirectX.  This is a very long road but rewarding.

Complete each project as listed below. Some projects are lessons.  The lesson may have its own sub-projects. 
If you have already done one of the projects, just read through it but don't do the work.

DO NOT PUT ANY ORDER IN THE PROJECT NAMES!

working here.... just finished the Github_Pull lesson



Proj_DX12WindowsMessageLoop

				TO Folder:    C:\modules\Davant\DX12Course101\Proj_DX12WindowsMessageLoop\
		Rename the cpp file that contains "main" to Proj_DX12WindowsMessageLoop.cpp.
		Compile and run the application.


		Complete lesson DX12WindowsMessageLoop.
			Working here...  Remember, the DX lessons build on each other, the windows and cpp lessons do not!
	

		

Proj_DX12CommandQueue
	ToDo - create lesson

Proj_DX12CommandListAndCommandAllocator
	ToDo - create lesson - this will include the command allocator

Proj_DX12SwapChain
	ToDo - create lesson

Proj_.... What else is needed to paint a blue screen????









Working .. what is next in the book?
	Go through chapter 4 and everywhere there is code that is in the ch 4 code sample, create a lesson to add that code.
	After the entire chapter is accounted for, have the student read chapter 4.

	Outline each section of the book and create content where needed.
	4.1 - Preliminaries
	4.1.1 - Direct3D 12 Overview - high level, no code needed
	4.1.2 - Com - already covered in com lessons
	4.1.3 - Texture Formats - high level
	4.1.4 - Swap Chain and Page Flipping
		Maybe create the swap chain and talk about textures.
	4.1.5 - Depth Buffering
		Maybe create this texture and review it.
	4.1.6 - Resources and Descriptors
		Maybe create descriptors if they are needed in the ch 4 code?
	4.1.7 - Multisampling Theory
		Notice the word "sampling" - later we will create a sampler.
		Supersampling renders to 4 times the needed resolution.
		Multisampling looks at the neighboring pixils and takes an average. This is faster.
	4.1.8 - Multisampling in Direct3D
		Multi sample section covers querying for support, but we use the next section "feature" levels.
	4.1.9 - Feature Levels
		Done - Lesson is done!
	4.1.10 - DirectX Graphics Infrastructure
		Done - Lesson is done, but add the Output Debug string
		Done - Add a lesson that adds the Output Debug string. This should be a c++ lesson and not be part of the Dx lesson. 
			Done - Create lesson				
			Done - After done, add the lesson to this course above.  
		Done - Next, add a 
			DX lesson that adds this code to the adapter loop.
	4.1.11 Checking Feature support
	4.1.12 Residency - The book does not manage residency. By default, adding a resource makes it resident and deleting it makes it evicted.

	4.2.1 The command queue and command list
		WORKING HERE...
			Create lesson above as this section is read.  
				
	4.2.2 CPU/GPU Synchronization
		Try not to add this lesson until we have already send a command list to the GPU that paints the screen.
		To make it work without synchonization, have the c++ code sleep for 10 seconds to make sure the old allocator is empty.

			
Remember, try to create lessons for each thing if possible. One that teaches the thing and one that adds it to the DX project.
