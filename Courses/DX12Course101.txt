This course has a set of projects that will help you program in DirectX.  This is a very long road but rewarding.

This course uses the book "3D Game Programming with DirectX12"; however, the book is not used until the end
because this assumes there are many areas of c++, and overall programming, that the student is not 
familiar with and needs help. By the end of this course, many c++ concepts will be reviewed and then
the book is used from that point on. The program built in this course is not exactly like the book sample
on purpose. This is to force the student to understand and not copy/paste their way through the course.

Complete each project as listed below. Some projects are lessons.  The lesson may have its own sub-projects. 
If you have already done one of the projects, just re-read them but you don't have to do the work.
If you have already done them, but don't remember them; you need to do them again.



-----------------------------------------
Projects
Place all work in the following directory structure: c:/modules/YourName/DX12Course101/ProjectNameHere/...

After several lessons, we will start to use github, an online place to put your code, so the directory will not change after that is started.



This course takes you to creating a box on the screen using DirectX.
This course is a combination of C++ lessons and DirectX lesson.

At the bottom of this document is APPENDIX A. 
APPENDIX A is a high level list of DirectX objects and API calls that we will be building/working toward.
After each DirectX lesson, you can see how each lesson's components fix into the larger application.

-------------------------------------------



Book - At some point in the course you will start reading the book "3D Game Programming with DirectX 12".
	It might be a good idea to read chapter 4 and then start these lessons; however, if you are not
	skilled in c++ you may need to wait and go though the lessons first. This is because these
	lessons go beyond the book and contain c++ lessons along the way.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Setup Github!!!
Moving forward, we will use github to store your code so the project name will not match the directory anymore.
We will use the same directory for the remaining Dx12 lessons.

In the github app, create a new repository named "Dx12CourseApp" in the C:\modules\your name\DX12Course101\

In the previous Dx12 lesson, you have code in the (C:\modules\you name\DX12Course101\Proj_AddOutputDebugString\YournameAppABC\) directory.
Copy all the files from that directory to the github directory you just created.
	For example I copied: 
		Directory DavantAppABC
		File DavantAppABC.sln
	If you see the ".vs" directory, you don't have to copy it. It will get generated the next time you compile in Visual Studio.
		


Now go to the github application and you should see all the files.
Commit to the local repository, give it a summary like "initial load".
Now publish to the github cloud. 

Open the solution.
Rename the file that has WinMain from "Proj_AddOutputDebugString.cpp" to "Proj_Dx12App.cpp".

Go back into github and you should see this change.
Notice it has a negative red [-] next to "Proj_AddOutputDebugString.cpp" because it does not exist anymore.
Notice is has a plus green [+] next to the file named "Proj_Dx12App.cpp" because it is a new one. Github does not know you changed the
	name, it only knows that one is gone and another has appreared.

There are several Visual Studio files that keep logs and other data that are not needed in github. They take up a large amound of memory
	so we want to set github to ignore them.
In github, look for a file that has an extension of ".ipch". It is usually a long filename. Right click on it and select "Ignore all .ipch files".
	The file still exists but will not be shown in github.
	Do the same for extension ".tlog".
	Do the same for extension ".log".

Commit your code and then publish to the cloud. You can add the summery name "clean up things" if you wish.

You are now ready to move on to the next set of projects.

Proj_DX12AddWindowsMessageLoop - NO NEW DIRECTORY - DO NOT create this directory for this project!	
	You will use your new directory that is using github.
	Open the visual studio solution.  It is located in the directory you just created for the github repository. 
		For example, for me it is: C:\modules\Davant\DX12Course101\Dx12CourseApp\

	This project will add in the windows loop code we did in project Proj_CppWindowsLoop.  

	This means the program from this lesson will have a windows message loop and the DirectX components from the DX lessons we have so far.
	This lesson will start to use github to keep your code files.

	Complete lesson DX12_AddWindowsMessageLoop.
	
	Git Tag lesson
		Now that you have updated github, it is time to "TAG" your code. Tagging your code creates a "Point in Time" copy

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
BOOK - Time to Read!
	OK, we have waited long enough and it's time to read the book!  
	The first few chapters, 1-3, cover math and geometry so I will not focus on those at this point.
	Read chapter 4 of the book "3D Game Programming with DirectX 12".
		
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		
	
Proj_DX12_DXGI_SAMPLE_DESC	
	This lesson does not have any code changes unless you want to try different multisample count options.
	It is here to review section 4.1.8 in the book.

	
	
Proj_Chapter4
	Open the visual studio solution.  
		For example, for me it is: C:\modules\Davant\DX12Course101\Dx12CourseApp\

	From here on out, you will be using the book.  Use the book to finish the initialization of DirectX.
	There are a few things still to do. Like the other objects that are setup, create functions for each
	of the following components and member variables in your myDirectX class. 
	You do not need to re-do components that have already been done.
	
	The following components still need to be added and initialized.
	Remember the book uses ComPtr, but you should make your own.

		Done - Add a ID3D12Fence * property and initialize it with a function named	
			"HRESULT myDirectX::InitializeFence(void)".
			Take the popup "Success" message from the last placed used and add it to this function.	
			
			After your done call this new "InitializeFence" function from the "initialize" function.
			
			Remember to call release on this objects in the myDirectX destructor.
			
			Understanding fences is covered in Chapter 4 in several sections. Code is covered in 
			section 4.3.2.
				
		Done - Add 3 properties to hold the descriptor sizes. Something like the following. These 
			should be private and goes in myDirectX.
				UINT mRtvDescriptorSize = 0;
				UINT mDsvDescriptorSize = 0;
				UINT mCbvSrvUavDescriptorSize = 0;
			Initialized these 3 descriptor size properties by creating a function and call that 
			function from the "Initialize" function.
			
			Take the popup "Success" message from the last placed used and add it to this function.
			
			Descriptors are reviewed in Chapter 4.  Code is covered in 
			section 4.3.2.
			
		Done - Add "Render Target View Descriptor" and "Depth Stencil View Descriptor" Heaps.
			Remember the book uses ComPtr, but you should make your own. 
			These should be private and goes in myDirectX.
			
			ID3D12DescriptorHeap * mpRtvID3D12DescriptorHeap = nullptr;
			ID3D12DescriptorHeap * mpDsvID3D12DescriptorHeap = nullptr;

			Initialized these 2 descriptor heaps by creating a function named InitializeRtvAndDsvDescriptorHeaps
			and call that function in your "Initialize" function. 
			
			Take the popup "Success" message from the last placed used and add it to this function.

			Remember to call release on this objects in the myDirectX destructor.
			
			Descriptors are reviewed in Chapter 4.  Code is covered in 
			section 4.3.6.
		
		Done - Add an int that is used to track the current back buffer. It will change 
			from 0 to 1 and 1 to 0... back and fourth. The reason is that we have 2
			render targets in this program. One for the screen the user is seeing and
			one that we are drawing to; hence the "double buffering" term.
			The "back buffer" is the one we are drawing to. This variable will keep 
			track of which of the two render targets is the back buffer at the current
			moment.
			This is mentioned in section 4.3.6.  This should be private and goes in myDirectX.
			
			int mCurrBackBuffer = 0; // toggles between 0 and 1 in this application.
		
		Done - Add a CurrentBackBufferView(..) function like shown in 4.3.6.
			This function returns a D3D12_CPU_DESCRIPTOR_HANDLE. 
			The descriptors are on the GPU, kept in descriptor heaps. We need to get at 
			those descriptors. This is where the handle comes into play.
				From the book "Our application references descriptors through handles."
				
			The book uses a helper class named CD3DX12_CPU_DESCRIPTOR_HANDLE. This class
			makes is easier to get a descriptor handle from the GPU. This class exists 
			in a set of libraries provided by Microsoft. The file we need is "d3dx12.h".
			You can get this file on github at "https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectX-Graphics-Samples".
			Once you download and unzip this, you can search for the file.  Copy and place the "d3dx12.h" 
			file and put it in the same directory your other .h and .cpp files.
			The file is now in the windows directory, but Visual Studio does not know about it.
			Add the file to the Visual Studio project by right clicking on header folder in Visual Studio,
			select "add"->"existing item", then select the file.
			Now it is a part of your Visual Studio project. 
			
			Now I know what your thinking, when I add a header file I also have to add the binary library
			file to my project as well. Well actually, this header has all the code in it so 
			there is no library file. Every class and function are in-lined; meaning the real code of the
			declarations, which are the definitions, are in the same header file.
			
			Now you can code without any errors:
				#include "d3dx12.h"
			
			Now you can add the code from the book. Here is what my code looks like.
			
				D3D12_CPU_DESCRIPTOR_HANDLE myDirectX::CurrentBackBufferView() const
				{
					return CD3DX12_CPU_DESCRIPTOR_HANDLE(
						mpRtvID3D12DescriptorHeap->GetCPUDescriptorHandleForHeapStart(),
						mCurrBackBuffer,
						mRtvDescriptorSize);
				}
			
			This code says, hay GPU... here is a descriptor heap, give me a "CPU Handle" to one of the
			descriptors in the heap!  Notice we also give it the size of each descriptor so the GPU
			knows how large each element is in the heap.
			First parameter is the start of the descriptor heap.
			Second parameter is the element number in the heap we want; either 0 or 1 in our case because
				we only have 2 elements at the moment (one for front and one for back buffer views)
			Third is the size of each element in the heap.
		
		
		
		Done - Add a DepthStencilView function like shown in 4.3.6.
			This function, like the "CurrentBackBufferView" function, is just a simple "get".
			Unlike the "CurrentBackBufferView", there is only one element in the heap so there is 
			no need to determine the "current" back buffer or anything else. We simply return
			the first element in the heap.
			
			Here is what my code looks like.
				D3D12_CPU_DESCRIPTOR_HANDLE myDirectX::DepthStencilView() const
				{
					return mpDsvID3D12DescriptorHeap->GetCPUDescriptorHandleForHeapStart();
				}
				
		Done - Create a ID3D12Resource pointer array to hold the actual back buffers on the GPU.
			We could just ask the swap chain for this interface pointer when we need it, but it
			will be easier and convenient to have a local variable.
			This way we don't have to ask the swap chain for them all the time.
					
			Here is what my code looks like. This should be private and goes in myDirectX.
				ID3D12Resource * mpSwapChainBufferList[2];
				
			In the destructor of myDirectX, call release on both of these.
				for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++)
				{
					if (mpSwapChainBufferList[i] != nullptr)
					{
						mpSwapChainBufferList[i]->Release();
					}
				}
		
		Done - Create a ID3D12Resource pointer to hold the depth stencil on the GPU. Only one of 
			these is needed. This way we don't have to as the swap chain for this all the time.
				ID3D12Resource * mpDepthStencilBuffer;

			In the destructor of myDirectX, call release on this.

				if (mpDepthStencilBuffer != nullptr)
				{
					mpDepthStencilBuffer->Release();
				}
						

		ToDo - Now that we have these resources, where do we set them?  
			Create an "OnResize()" function for the myDirectX class. This function can be called
			any time the user changes the screen size. It basically will reset the swap chain back
			buffers. 
			

		
		
		ToDo - Add a function to get the actual current back buffer interface ID3D12Resource*.
			Name it something like "CurrentBackBuffer()".
			This will come from the swap chain because when we created the swap chain it automatically
			created two GPU resources.
			
			Here is what my code looks like. Notice it uses the same mCurrBackBuffer member variable
			we used previously in the "CurrentBackBufferView(..)" function.
		
				NOTE!! THIS code is in the myDirectX, just commented out.
		
	
	Github - "Commit to Master", give it a nice summary name, and then "Push origin" which will push it to the github cloud.
	
	Git Tag lesson
		Now that you have updated github, it is time to "TAG" your code. Tagging your code creates a "Point in Time" copy
		of your code. 
		Review the github lesson "Github_Tag" if needed, and use the tag "v1.005_Proj_Chapter4" 
		to tag your project.
		Using a browser, go to your online github repository and see if you see the new tag under "releases".



Done!  Wow, you did it!
