This course has a set of projects that will help you program in DirectX.  This is a very long road but rewarding.

This course uses materials that are put together my different people from the industry. I would not expect 
them to be Christian, but probably have some Christian values because our culture was strongly influenced 
by Christianity. I avoid materials that use bad language or crude commentary.
I will include verses between lessons so we don't loose sight of what really matters. 

Exodus 20:16 - Old Testament
	You must not lie or deceive one another. 
	
Isaiah 53:5 - Old Testament
	.. he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities;
	upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed.
	
1 Peter 2:24
	"He himself bore our sins" in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sins and live 
	for righteousness; "by his wounds you have been healed." 

Hebrews 11:6 
	.. and without faith it is impossible to please God, for whoever would draw near to God must 
	believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.
 
Acts 18 - 1 through 4
	Paul....met a certain Jew named Aquila...with his wife Priscilla... and because Paul was a 
	tentmaker as they were, he stayed and worked with them.
	Every Sabbath he reasoned in the synagogue, trying to persuade Jews and Greeks.

	

This course uses the book "3D Game Programming with DirectX12"; however, the book is not used until later
because this assumes there are many areas of c++, and overall programming, that the student is not 
familiar with and needs help. Through the course, many c++ concepts will be reviewed and then
the book is used from that point on. The program built in this course is not exactly like the book sample
on purpose. This is to force the student to understand and not copy/paste their way through the course.

Complete each project as listed below. Some projects are lessons.  The lesson may have its own sub-projects. 
If you have already done one of the projects, just re-read them but you don't have to do the work.
If you have already done them, but don't remember them; you need to do them again.



-----------------------------------------
Projects
Place all work in the following directory structure: c:/modules/YourName/DX12Course101/ProjectNameHere/...

After several lessons, we will start to use github, an online place to put your code, 
so the directory will not change after that is started.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Setup Github!!!
Moving forward, we will use github to store your code so the project name will not match the directory anymore.
We will use the same directory for the remaining Dx12 lessons.

In the github app, create a new repository named "Dx12CourseApp" in the C:\modules\your name\DX12Course101\

In the previous Dx12 lesson, you have code in the (C:\modules\you name\DX12Course101\Proj_AddOutputDebugString\YournameAppABC\) directory.
Copy all the files from that directory to the github directory you just created.
	For example I copied: 
		Directory DavantAppABC
		File DavantAppABC.sln
	If you see the ".vs" directory, you don't have to copy it. It will get generated the next time you compile in Visual Studio.
		


Now go to the github application and you should see all the files.
Commit to the local repository, give it a summary like "initial load".
Now publish to the github cloud. 

Open the solution.
Rename the file that has WinMain from "Proj_AddOutputDebugString.cpp" to "Proj_Dx12App.cpp".

Go back into github and you should see this change.
Notice it has a negative red [-] next to "Proj_AddOutputDebugString.cpp" because it does not exist anymore.
Notice is has a plus green [+] next to the file named "Proj_Dx12App.cpp" because it is a new one. Github does not know you changed the
	name, it only knows that one is gone and another has appreared.

There are several Visual Studio files that keep logs and other data that are not needed in github. They take up a large amound of memory
	so we want to set github to ignore them.
In github, look for a file that has an extension of ".ipch". It is usually a long filename. Right click on it and select "Ignore all .ipch files".
	The file still exists but will not be shown in github.
	Do the same for extension ".tlog".
	Do the same for extension ".log".

Commit your code and then publish to the cloud. You can add the summery name "clean up things" if you wish.

You are now ready to move on to the next set of projects.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Proj_DX12AddWindowsMessageLoop - NO NEW DIRECTORY - DO NOT create this directory for this project!	
	You will use your new directory that is using github.
	Open the visual studio solution.  It is located in the directory you just created for the github repository. 
		For example, for me it is: C:\modules\Davant\DX12Course101\Dx12CourseApp\

	This project will add in the windows loop code we did in project Proj_CppWindowsLoop.  

	This means the program from this lesson will have a windows message loop and the DirectX components from the DX lessons we have so far.
	This lesson will start to use github to keep your code files.

	Complete lesson DX12_AddWindowsMessageLoop.
	
	Git Tag lesson
		Now that you have updated github, it is time to "TAG" your code. Tagging your code creates a "Point in Time" copy
		of your code. 
		Review the github lesson "Github_Tag", and use the tag "v1.001_DX12_AddWindowsMessageLoop" to tag your project.



Proj_DX12CommandQueue 
	Open the visual studio solution.  It is located in the directory you just created for the github repository. 
		For example, for me it is: C:\modules\Davant\DX12Course101\Dx12CourseApp\
	
	Complete lesson DX12_CommandQueue.
	
	Github - "Commit to Master", give it a nice summary name, and then "Push origin" which will push it to the github cloud.
	
	Git Tag lesson
		Now that you have updated github, it is time to "TAG" your code. Tagging your code creates a "Point in Time" copy
		of your code. 
		Review the github lesson "Github_Tag", and use the tag "v1.002_Proj_DX12CommandQueue" to tag your project.
		Using a browser, go to your online github repository and see if you see the new tag under "releases".


Proj_DX12CommandListAndCommandAllocator	
	Open the visual studio solution.  It is located in the directory you just created for the github repository. 
		For example, for me it is: C:\modules\Davant\DX12Course101\Dx12CourseApp\

	Complete lesson DX12CommandListAndCommandAllocator.
	
	Github - "Commit to Master", give it a nice summary name, and then "Push origin" which will push it to the github cloud.
	
	Git Tag lesson
		Now that you have updated github, it is time to "TAG" your code. Tagging your code creates a "Point in Time" copy
		of your code. 
		Review the github lesson "Github_Tag" if needed, and use the tag "v1.003_Proj_DX12CommandListAndCommandAllocator" 
		to tag your project.
		Using a browser, go to your online github repository and see if you see the new tag under "releases".
		
		
Proj_DX12SwapChain
	Open the visual studio solution.  
		For example, for me it is: C:\modules\Davant\DX12Course101\Dx12CourseApp\

	Complete lesson DX12_SwapChain.
	
	Github - "Commit to Master", give it a nice summary name, and then "Push origin" which will push it to the github cloud.
	
	Git Tag lesson
		Now that you have updated github, it is time to "TAG" your code. Tagging your code creates a "Point in Time" copy
		of your code. 
		Review the github lesson "Github_Tag" if needed, and use the tag "v1.004_Proj_DX12_SwapChain" 
		to tag your project.
		Using a browser, go to your online github repository and see if you see the new tag under "releases".

BOOK - Time to Read!
	OK, we have waited long enough and it's time to read the book!  
	The first few chapters, 1-3, cover math and geometry so I will not focus on those at this point.
	Read chapter 4 of the book "3D Game Programming with DirectX 12".

Proj_DX12_DXGI_SAMPLE_DESC	
	This lesson does not have any code changes unless you want to try different multisample count options.
	It is here to review section 4.1.8 in the book.



Download and get the sample code for the book running.
