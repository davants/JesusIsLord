DXGI_SAMPLE_DESC

Notes from the book on 4.1.8 - Filling out the DXGI_SAMPLE_DESC struct (Section name in the book is multisampling)
	We must fill out the DXGI_SAMPLE_DESC struct. We need this for both the swap chain and depth buffer.
	Also along those lines, the back buffer and depth buffer must have the same multisampling count.
	
	DXGI_SAMPLE_DESC struct has 2 properties.
		UINT Count; 
		UINT Quality;
	"Count" is the number of samples to take per pixel.
	"Quality" is "Quality Level"; however, what this means changes across hardware. 
		It depends on the texture format AND the number of samples to take per pixel!
	
	How do we fill this out? How do we get the values needed for this structure?
	For a given format, you can query for the count and quality level.
	We use the device interface function "CheckFeatureSupport" method/function.
		Input is format, sample count and a flag about the multisampling we are checking for suppport.
		Output from the call is the quality level.
		
		The value you get back can be used when creating the DXGI_SAMPLE_DESC.
		The DX12_DXGI_SAMPLE_DESC.Quality property can be set from 0 to the value
		returned by the "CheckFeatureSupport" (minus 1). Meaning you get to decide
		what you want to use.


We will not change the code we already have in place, but we do want to look at it.

Review the class method "void myDirectX::InitializeFactoryDeviceAndHardware(void)".

Notice we set the sample count to 1 for the query to mpD3dDevice->CheckFeatureSupport(..).

Feel free to try different values to see what is supported; however, you do not have to do this
if you don't want to. 

Now look in the "HRESULT myDirectX::InitializeSwapChain(void)" class method.
Notice the DXGI_SWAP_CHAIN_DESC struct we fill out has a DXGI_SAMPLE_DESC member named "SampleDesc".
We set the count and Quality of that member.  

In my code I set the count to 1; however, if you have reasonably new GPU you can set this to a higher value
like 4.
