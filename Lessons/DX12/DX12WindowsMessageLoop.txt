Tasks for this Step:
	Add windows loop logic to your DX Program.

This lesson assumes you already have a DX program that creates some DX components and it outputs the adapters to the
visual studio output window.

It also assumes you have a basic windows message program that you can use as a guide.


----------------------
Lesson

Step 1)

Simply add the message loop code to the DX project. In the next lesson, a base class can be created and so on...



working here.....Remember, the DX lessons build on each other, the windows and cpp lessons do not!
				This means we start from a previous DX lesson and add the windows loop to it, not vice versa.
