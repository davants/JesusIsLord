Tasks for this Step:
	Add the adapters to the Visual Studio Output Window


This lesson assumes you have already completed a function that loops through all the adapters on the computer. 
In one of the previous Dx lessons there was a function named GetHardwareAdapter that did this.

----------------------
Lesson



Step 1) If you haven't, review the CppVisualStudioOutputDebugInfo lesson.

Step 2) Update the GetHardwareAdapter function. (you may have named it something else) 
	Add code to output each adapter to the Visual Studio output window even if it is not the one you are looking for.
	Output the memory of each adapter and it name.
	This will allow you to see all the video adapters.




Sample Code - something like the following in the adapter loop.
	This code assumes you have a valid adapter pointer (IDXGIAdapter1*) named pAdapterTEMP.


		// Output info on the video card
		// Create a struct to hold the adapter's information and call GetDesc1 to fill it with data.
		DXGI_ADAPTER_DESC1 vDXGI_ADAPTER_DESC1;
		pAdapterTEMP->GetDesc1(&vDXGI_ADAPTER_DESC1);
		wstring sStart = L"\n\nVideo Card Info and memory: ";
		wstring sAdapterDescription = vDXGI_ADAPTER_DESC1.Description;
		wstring sSpace = L" ";
		wstring sAdapterMemory = std::to_wstring(vDXGI_ADAPTER_DESC1.DedicatedVideoMemory);
		wstring sEnd = L"\n";
		wstring sCombined = sStart + sAdapterDescription + sSpace + sAdapterMemory + sEnd;
		OutputDebugString(sCombined.c_str());
