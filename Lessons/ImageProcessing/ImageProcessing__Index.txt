This is a list for searching purposes.  

Per article https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/chuckw/2012/05/04/direct3d-11-textures-and-block-compression/
DirectXTex is the latest library that will support many image loading bitmaps, resizing and converting them, generating mipmaps, 
compressing, and then writing them out as .DDS files. 

The D3DX library is retired.



Done - Read article above.
Done - Download code from github - https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTex to C:\modules\Davant\ImageProcessing
ToDo - Run...  DirectXTex_Desktop_2017.sln 
		There is another project called "DirectXTex_Desktop_2017_Win10.sln", it does not have the samples, just the library.

ToDo - Read the "ReadMe.txt" for the source code on github.

		
Working here...
