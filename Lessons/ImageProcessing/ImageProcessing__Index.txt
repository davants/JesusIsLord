This group of lessons are focused on image processing related to DirectX.
This is a list for searching purposes.  

Per article https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/chuckw/2012/05/04/direct3d-11-textures-and-block-compression/
DirectXTex is the latest library that will support many image loading bitmaps, resizing and converting them, generating mipmaps, 
compressing, and then writing them out as .DDS files. 

Documentation is available at <https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTex/wiki>.

The D3DX library is retired.



Done - Read article above.
Done - Download code from github - https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTex to C:\modules\Davant\ImageProcessing
ToDo - Run...  DirectXTex_Desktop_2017.sln 
		There is another project called "DirectXTex_Desktop_2017_Win10.sln", it does not have the samples, just the library.

Done - Read the "ReadMe.txt" for the source code on github.

ToDo - Review wiki documentation https://github.com/Microsoft/DirectXTex/wiki

	TGA (Truevision Graphics Adapter), also known as TARGA (Truevision Advanced Raster Graphics Adapter) file format, is a raster graphics file format. It is used to store and inter-change deep pixel images, paint, and image manipulation programs that need to store image data of up to 32 bits per pixel.
	
	HRR High-dynamic-range imaging (HDRI) is a high dynamic range (HDR) technique used in imaging and photography to reproduce a greater dynamic range of luminosity than is possible with standard digital imaging or photographic techniques. The aim is to present a similar range of luminance to that experienced through the human visual system.
