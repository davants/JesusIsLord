DISABLE_DEACTIVATION
	From what I understand, objects can fall asleep which saves processing time. 
	Like when I delete an object and things on it don't move. 
	"DISABLE_DEACTIVATION" means it is not allowed to go to sleep.
	
	m_pickedBody->setActivationState(DISABLE_DEACTIVATION);
	
	This is used for picking and holding something so it does not go to sleep while 
	being held.

ISLAND_SLEEPING 
	Note from some blog.
	This is set when a group of nearby objects is deactivated.
