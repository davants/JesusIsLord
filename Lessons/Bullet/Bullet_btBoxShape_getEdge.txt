virtual void getEdge(int i,btVector3& pa,btVector3& pb) const;

This function will return one of the edges of a shape by updating 
the passed parameters pa and pb.

The returned edge is the i, index, of the edge in the shape.

Use the getNumEdges() function to get the number of edges. 
For example, you could loop through the edges using this 
number of edges value.

What is an Edge?

	An Edge is a two point line. 
	
	For example, say we are looking down on a box. 
		The X axis is horizontal; -X is to the left and +X is to the right.
		The Z axis is verticle; -Z is Up and +Z is down.
		It has a rectangle box shape which means 6 sides.
		It has a total width of 2 on the x axis, y not visable because we are looking down but we will
		say it is 2 and z is 8.

		There will be 12 total edges. Two are documented below.
		
	      		
		 __ __	<--- This Edge is 2 points to make a line. One p is (-1, 1, -4) and the other p is (1, 1, -4).
