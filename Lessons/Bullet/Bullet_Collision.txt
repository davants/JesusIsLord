This doc is not a lesson. It is just a doc to keep notes as I learn about bullet and physics engines.

Term: Collision Groups and Masks

Term: Broadphase

	A broadphase is the algorithm of choice to efficiently decide whether it is possible for two 
	colliders to collide, without using the actual collision detection algorithm that is more expensive.
	Typically, a broadphase keeps track of bounding volumes, usually AABBs, of all colliders. The 
	broadphase produces a list of collider pairs whose AABBs are colliding. These collider pairs 
	are then passed on to the collision detection algorithm to decide whether they actually collide.

DTS: Objects are filtered down from boardphase to more detailed checks. 
	At each phase, pairs of objects are created. The next detailed check can remove
	objects(pairs) from the list.
