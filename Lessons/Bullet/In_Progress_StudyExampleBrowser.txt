Note - Pivot Point - https://youtu.be/O8c8yczdGkg
	A pivot point is the 3d location that an object pivots around. For a box, it would be the center of the box by default.
	The pivot point can be changed.
	
btPoint2PointConstraint	
	The sample creates a btPoint2PointConstraint between a selected object and a position in 3d space where the mouse cursor is.
		You can create this by connecting two object or with a vector to a position in 3d space. This "basic" sample uses the 3 float vector.
		The "basic" sample sets the member property "m_setting" (type btConstraintSetting.

btConstraintSetting		
	The class btPoint2PointConstraint has a member named m_setting of type btConstraintSetting.

ToDo - The mouse does change an object.  How?
	OpenGLExampleBrowser.cpp file has mouse functions.
		MyMouseMoveCallback
			...
			
			movePickedBody(rayFrom,rayTo);  
				
				How this works is that a new orgit is created and connected to the body.
			
				btPoint2PointConstraint* pickCon = static_cast<btPoint2PointConstraint*>(m_pickedConstraint);
				if (pickCon)
				{
					//keep it at the same picking distance

					btVector3 newPivotB;

					btVector3 dir = rayToWorld - rayFromWorld;
					dir.normalize();
					dir *= m_oldPickingDist;

					newPivotB = rayFromWorld + dir;
					pickCon->setPivotB(newPivotB);
					return true;
				}
			
			
			
			
		Also note that on release the removePickingConstraint() function is called which
			will set the body back to its previous activation state and delete the 
			m_pickedConstraint from the dynamics world.
		
		MyMouseButtonCallback - clicks

			sCurrentDemo->mouseButtonCallBack(...);
			
				pickBody(rayFrom, rayTo);
			
					m_pickedBody, a member of CommonRigidBodyBase, is set!
					
					// m_savedState, and int, is a member of CommonRigidBodyBase 
					// Is set to 1 by the next line. This returns m_activationState1 which is
					// a int. It is not in btRigidBody, but in its base class btCollisionObject.
					// I think this is "saved" so it can be put back later.
					m_savedState = m_pickedBody->getActivationState(); // returns m_activationState1 
					
					// Now change the state to "DISABLE_DEACTIVATION". From what I understand, objects
					// can fall asleep which saves processing time. Like when I delete an object and 
					// things on it don't move. "DISABLE_DEACTIVATION" means it is not allowed to go to 
					// sleep.
					m_pickedBody->setActivationState(DISABLE_DEACTIVATION);
					
					btVector3 localPivot = body->getCenterOfMassTransform().inverse() * pickPos;
					btPoint2PointConstraint* p2p = new btPoint2PointConstraint(*body, localPivot);
					m_dynamicsWorld->addConstraint(p2p, true);
					m_pickedConstraint = p2p;
					btScalar mousePickClamping = 30.f;
					p2p->m_setting.m_impulseClamp = mousePickClamping;
					//very weak constraint for picking
					p2p->m_setting.m_tau = 0.001f;

					m_oldPickingPos = rayToWorld;
					m_hitPos = pickPos;
					m_oldPickingDist = (pickPos - rayFromWorld).length();

					
					
					
					
CommonExampleInterface abstract base class
	// CommonExampleInterface contains several pure virtual functions. I guess each example will 
	// implement these functions. For example, stepSimulation(float deltaTime) and renderScene() are
	// a few of the pure virtual functions.
	initPhysics() is a pure virtual function. It is called for each demo every time one is started.
	
	
struct CommonRigidBodyBase : public CommonExampleInterface
	initPhysics is not implemented.
	
struct BasicExample : public CommonRigidBodyBase	
	initPhysics() is implemented!
			
			
	
"selectDemo(..)" function is called when changing the demo example. It is passed the index of the 
	example in the gDefaultExamples static array.
	From the index it will get a function pointer to the "create" function for the example in question.
	selectDemo then creates an "OpenGLGuiHelper" object, then a CommonExampleOptions object. The 
	CommonExampleOptions takes the "OpenGLGuiHelper" as a constructor parameter.
	The "create" function pointer is called, passing the CommonExampleOptions.
	Finally, the "initPhysics(..)" function is called.
	
	
gDefaultExamples
	There is a global static list of ExampleEntry objects.  static ExampleEntry gDefaultExamples[]=....
	It is initialized with 132 ExampleEntry objects. The third parameter of the ExampleEntry is a 
	pointer a global create function for that type of object. It is not called at this time, we just
	have a pointer to the create function.
	When it is called, each global function will instantiate the object that derives from CommonExampleInterface.
	For example, the second item in the global list is a BasicExample object.
	When an example is selected in the example browser, the selectDemo(..) function is called which will
	call the create function pointer, to create the object.
	Also note, the "initPhysics(..)" function is also called by the selectDemo(..) function which 
	adds the objects to the world.

main.cpp
	
	main function	
	
		ExampleEntriesAll examples; // constructor uses a vector (custom vector that byte aligns automatically)
			// in this vector will be ExampleEntry objects.
			// ExampleEntry is a struct that holds int menuLevel, name, description, int options
			// and a function pointer to CommonExampleInterface::CreateFunc.
			
		examples.initExampleEntries();
			Clear out the ExampleEntry vector list.
			Loop through the gAdditionalRegisteredExamples list and add them to the ExampleEntry vector list.
				It is empty so nothing is added.
			Loop through the gDefaultExamples and add all these to the ExampleEntry vector list. Total is 132.
				
		
		Loop: The exampleBrowser->update(..) is called in a ongoing loop.
			This calls sCurrentDemo->stepSimulation(deltatime);

				This eventually calls body->getMotionState()->setWorldTransform(interpolatedTransform);
	
			Next, the sCurrentDemo->renderScene() is called.
				This calls CommonRigidBase::renderScene().
					calls m_guiHelper->syncPhysicsToGraphics(m_dynamicsWorld);
						This calls others and gets a pointer to b3PublicGraphicsInstance.
						The position and orientation is updated.
					and
					calls m_guiHelper->render(m_dynamicsWorld);
						calls m_data->m_glApp->m_renderer->renderScene();
							calls 	renderSceneInternal(B3_CREATE_SHADOWMAP_RENDERMODE);
									and
									renderSceneInternal(B3_USE_SHADOWMAP_RENDERMODE);
			
			So, conclusion is that a list of motion state objects is created then a loop will 
				update the graphical versions. This is different that the other example where
				an interface function is called.
