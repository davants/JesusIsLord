Tasks for this Step:
	Const


Video - https://youtu.be/k55CRqm1gzk

In the video, he did not say what it means for a function to be const. It means that the function is not allowed to change anything.
In the video, the function only output to the screen so the function did not change variables.
A good example of a const function would be one that "gets" some value from the object. 
For example: 
// We'll say that this function is a member of a Dog class and one of the private members is a string named "mName" that holds the dog's name.
// This function can be a const because the function does not change the mName variable, it just returns a copy of it.
	string getName(void) const
	{
		return mName;
	}

Lessons

ToDo - CppConstFunctionParameters
	Write a program that has a function that takes 2 parameters that are pointers to ints. 
	Make one const and the other without the const.
	Try to change both values in the function and see what the compilter does.
