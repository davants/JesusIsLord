CppPolymorphismA

Create the same project at the video, step through each step as he did it so you can see things clearly.
Next, create one more type of animal and override the eat function as you did for the ant and lion.
Test this new object like you did for the other animals.
Next, create a vector of animal pointers.  
	vector<Animal *> vListOfAnimals;
Fill this list with many different ants, lions and your new animal.
Next, loop through the list and call Eat() for each one.  Polymorphism at its best!


NOTES:
A parent class is also called a base class.
A child class is also called a derived class.
If a parent/base class has a pure virtual function it means the function does not have a body in the base/parent class.
If a parent/base class has a pure virtual function you can not create an object from it; however, you can create
a pointer to it because a pointer is not the object, just a variables that holds addresses.
If a parent/base class has a pure virtual function then the child/derived class should override the function if you
plan on creating an object.

Last, you can create a parent class pointer and have it point to child objects because the child inherits from the parent.
