CppLesson1_WinApp


Visual Studio 2017
New project->Visual C++ -> Windows Desktop application
	Name the project YourFirstName + AppABC.  (example: DavantAppABC)  (No Spaces or unusual charactors)
	Have visual studio create a directory for your solution. (This is a checkbox in the lower right.)
	Click Ok to go to the next screen.
	Click Next
	Select windows application
	Don't select empty project

Visual Studio will create a simple windows program. Compile and run.

Open the DavantAppABC.cpp file. (file name will be different)

Control A to highlight all text in the file and hit delete.

Add the following code to the file.

Code:
	#include "stdafx.h"

	int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE prevInstance,	PSTR cmdLine, int showCmd)

	{
		MessageBox(nullptr, L"Hello World", L"Working!!", MB_OK);
		return 0;
	}


Here is what the code is doing.

#include "stdafx.h"
	This include file has basic other includes files in it that support commands that are common.  Like input/output include files.
	When you use the #include "some filename" code in your program, you are actually adding code that some other programmer wrote. Isn't it nice to share!

int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance, HINSTANCE prevInstance,	PSTR cmdLine, int showCmd)

	The "WinMain function is where the program will start. 
	The windows operating system will calls the WinMain function when your program is started by the user.

MessageBox(nullptr, L"Hello World", L"Working!!", MB_OK);
	This will pop up a screen for the user to click ok.

Compile and run the program.
Debug the app, step through the code.


Note that Visual Studio has a solution file that groups all the files needed to build your program.
It will be called "DavantAppABC.sln".  Use this file to re-open your Visual Studio Solution.
