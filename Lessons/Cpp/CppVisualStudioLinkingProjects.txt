Note: In this video he uses static libraries. A static library code is kept separate, but final compiled 
	machine code is not separate. A static library's source code actually gets compiled into your application's exe. 
	
	This is different from a dynamic link library (dll). A dynamic link library also keeps its source code separate; 
	however, it also keeps it compiled code sepeate as well. Meaning a dll is not compiled into your application's exe. 
	A dynamic library is built into a "dll" file. So this means the compiled result is in its own file.	
	When you ship your application you will ship your exe and the dll.
	When you start your application's exe, it will look for the ".dll" file.
