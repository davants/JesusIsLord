Note: In this video he uses static libraries. A static library code is kept separate, but final compiled 
	machine code is not separate. A static library's source code actually gets compiled into your application's exe. 
	
	This is different from a dynamic link library (dll). A dynamic link library also keeps its code separate and it also 
	keeps it compiled code sepeate as well. It is not compiled into your application's exe. 
	A dynamic library is built into a "dll" file. So this means the compiled result is in its own file.
	When you start your application's exe, it will look for the ".dll" file.  Why do this? Two reasons.
	Well, if you have the same dll being used in 20 applications it saves disk space. This is not really an issue with today's computers.
	The second reason is to use someone else's compiled dll file without having to have their source code. All you need is the 
	".h" (header) files and you never get to see the source code. This is how the DirectX SDK works. We get the header files but
	the implemented source code is hidden from us.
	
	What to use?  For your own code, use static libraries, after all it is your code so there is no need to hide anything. 
	If you are writing code that you will sell and don't want to hand over 	your source code then use dynamic libraries.
