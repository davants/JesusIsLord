Tasks for this Step:
	Creating and using a static variables in a class.



Overview
A static variable in a class is kind of like a global variable for just that class.
A static variable in a class only exist 1 time in memory for all the objects created for that class; meaning it is a shared variable.
Example:
	Say I have a class named person.
	Say person has a static variable named OldestPersonsAge.
	If I create 10 person objects and set OldestPersonsAge to 98, all 10 person objects will have the value of 98 for the OldestPersonsAge variable.
		This is because all objects share the same memory for the static variables.

This video is a bit confusing at first, but when you see the code at the end it helps; maybe watch it a couple of times and then 
re-read the "Overview" above.

Lessons

Create a console app with a "person" class that has a static int variable named oldestAge.
Have the class also have an int age variable that is a normal variable (not static).
Create a "setAge" function for the class that sets the age. 
	Inside the "setAge" after setting the age class variable also set the oldestAge static variable if the value is higher.
Create 10 persons and set the ages for all to different values.
Now output all the persons age and oldestAge.

Notice that the age variables are different per object but the oldest is not because all classes share it.
