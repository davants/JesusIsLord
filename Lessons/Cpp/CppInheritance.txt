Overview
You can create a class that gets all the functionality of another class by "deriving" from it. 
For example
	You can create a "animal" class as a custom data type.
	Next, you can create a "dog" class that you derive from "animal" and the "dog" will get all the "animal" member variables and functions.
	In this example, the animal is the parent class (sometime called base class) and the dog is the child class (sometimes called derived class).

CppInheritanceFruit

Create a program where you have 3 classes. One class is a base class and the other 2 classes will derive from the base class.

Base Class
	"fruit"

Derived Classes
	"apple"
	"tomato" - Yes, tomato is a fruit.. look it up!

Add member variables and functions in the base class so that the derived classes will get them for free.
	fruit
		string color;
		int weight;

Add a member function to the derived classes that would not go in the base class.
	apple
		void apple::addPeanutbutter(void);

	tomato
		void tomato::addToPizza(void);
	
In main, create and use the classes.
