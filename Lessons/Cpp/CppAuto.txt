Tasks for this Step:
	auto key word

Notes:
	The "auto" keyword makes the compiler fiture out the data type; at compile time.

		Note: In the video he says that the "auto" type is set at runtime, but it is actually at compile time.

Create a directory according to the structure specified in the course.
Place the lessons below in their own sub-directory naming it the lesson name.

CppAuto


Create a vector of strings. Use push back to add some strings.
Loop through the vector using the iterator, not the random access brackets [i].
	Output them to the screen.
	Use a "for loop".

Now convert the iterator to have its datatype set by the "auto" keyword. To do this, initialize the 
iterator in the "for loop".

Example:
	From:
		for(vector<string>::iterator item = vecOfStrings.begin() ; .....)
	To:
		for(auto item = vecOfStrings.begin() ; .....)

		// The compiler can figure out the datatype for "item" by looking at your vector list and the return type of the "begin()" function.
		// This is alot better than having to give the type "vector<string>::iterator".  
		// If you are looping through a std::map then the type name is even more complex so auto is a life-saver.
