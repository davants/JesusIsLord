Overview
An "assert" is a macro that will kill your program if the expression in the assert is false. It will output information if this happens.
If the expression is true then nothing will happen and the program will continue as normal.

Asserts are used for debugging and stopping your program is something bad is discovered.
For example, say you are connecting to the GPU graphics card in your code, but for some reason you are not able to.
At that point you can use the assert to kill the program because there is no reason to continue.
