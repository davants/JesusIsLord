Tasks for this Step:
	Vectors 
	Iterators


Notes:
	You will hear them say container classes. This is just different types of lists.
		For example, Map list, vector list, etc...
	You may also want to watch the CppMap lesson because it also talks about iterators.
	
Definition Iterator:
	One definition of an iterator: it is a pointer to the key/value pair.

		This one does not have talking, just music in the background. I turned off the music because it started to drive me crazy!

Lessons

Create a directory according to the structure specified in the course.
Place the lessons below in their own sub-directory naming it the lesson name.

CppVectors2Iterators

Create a vector of strings. Use push back to add some strings.
Loop through the vector using the iterator, not the random access brackets [i].
	Output them to the screen.
	Use a "for loop".
