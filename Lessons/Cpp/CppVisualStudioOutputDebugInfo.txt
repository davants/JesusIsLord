Tasks for this Step:

Lessons

Place the lessons below in their own sub-directory naming it the lesson name.

CppVisualStudioOutputDegugInfo


Create console application with a simple "hello world" structure.

Add the windows.h file to the project along with string.

Create a wide char string variable, wstring, and set it to the text you want to output to the debug window.
Because you are using a wstring, you will have to add an L in front of the text you add.
Next, call the windows OutputDebugString(..) function with your wstring. 
	Note: The OutputDebugString function does not take wstring, it takes an array of wide chars; therefore, 
		pass the OutputDebugString(..) function an array of wide chars by calling the "c_str()" function of the wstring class.
Next, in visual studio look for the "output" windows at the bottom. You may have to click a tab to show it.


Here is the complete code.

#include "stdafx.h"
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <Windows.h>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
	cout << "hello world" << endl;

	wstring s = L"Hello Output Window! I'm writing to you.";
	OutputDebugString( s.c_str() );

    return 0;
}
