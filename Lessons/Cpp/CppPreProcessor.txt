Notes from site (you don't need to read this article) - http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/preprocessor/
Preprocessor directives are lines included in the code of programs preceded by a hash sign (#). These lines are not program statements but directives for the preprocessor. The preprocessor examines the code before actual compilation of code begins and resolves all these directives before any code is actually generated by regular statements.

----------------------------------------------------------
Macros
A macro is a preprocessor piece of code. This means it gets processed before your program is compiled.

These following videos use the #define preprocessor macro. Realize that what is happening is that your code is changed/updated by using macros.
The macro code is swiched out each time the precompiler finds the macro name.
After the preprocessor has found all the macro names and switched them for the macro code, then your program will be compiled.
