Github_Tag

After you have pushed your code into the cloud you can "Pull" the code to another computer.
On this other computer, if you make an update to the code and then commit and then push again, the new code will be in the cloud repository.

Let's say you pushed 3 weeks ago because you were at a good stopping point and everything was working.
Then 2 weeks ago, you added a new feature and again committed and pushed.
Then last week you made another change and again committed and pushed.

A friend wants to get your code, but you know he should get the one from 2 week ago because the latests one is not tested yet.

How do you do this?

Release or Tag

You can mark a point in time for your code in the cloud. You can "Tag" it with a name and if someone pulls using that name then
they will get the code exactly what it looked like when it was given that Tag.  
Most of the time you will use a version number like "v1.43". 

Now you can tell your friend to pull the code using that Tag and he will get the one from 2 weeks ago.

Tagging also helps you as you build your projects. You may make a change, removing some code, and then a few weeks later you may want
to see what it looked like before you updated.


Here is a web page on this. https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging


Step 1) You cannot Tag in the github GUI application, you must do it from the command line; however, you can get to the 
	command line from the GUI.
	Select "Repository" then "Open in Command Prompt". - You may have to load the git command line tool. It will prompt you if
		you need to load the command line tool. Use the standard settings. After loading, you will have to close the Github 
		desktop app and re-open it.
	You will see the command prompt application open.
Step 2) Type "git tag YOUR_TAG_NAME_WITH_NO_SPACES"
	For example: git tag v1.001

Step 3) If you want the update the server so it is also has the tag, do the following on the command line.
	git push origin YOUR_TAG_NAME_WITH_NO_SPACES


Done! 

Step 4) Validate that everything worked using the github web site.
	Navigate to your repository online. For example: https://github.com/davants/Dx12CourseApp
	Below the name of the app, you will see 4 links "# commits" "# branch" "# release" "# contributor"
	Click the "# release" link.  (# should be 1 if this is your first tag)
	You will see the tag name. Now you or others can get your code at that point in time.
