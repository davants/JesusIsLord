Github Pull

This lesson is to inform about what a "Pull" means.

You can use "Pull" to get files from your repository. So what is the difference between "Pull" and "Clone"?

Github is designed to work on projects in teams of programmers, not just by yourself.
If you are working on some files and make updates, you can update the cloud repository for others to see and get your changes.
Likewise, someone else may have make some changes and you want to get their updates.
This is what "Pull" is all about. 

See these notes from stack overflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3620633/what-is-the-difference-between-pull-and-clone-in-git

	git clone is how you get a local copy of an existing repository to work on. It's usually only used once for a given repository, unless you want to have multiple working copies of it around. (Or want to get a clean copy after messing up your local one...)

	git pull (or git fetch + git merge) is how you update that local copy with new commits from the remote repository. If you are collaborating with others, it is a command that you will run frequently.



------------------------------

In laymen language we can say:
 • Clone: Get a working copy of the remote repository.
 • Pull: I am working on this, please get me the new changes that may be updated by others.
